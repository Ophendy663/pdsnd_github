### Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Python script is developped to understand the data related to bikeshare systems for three cities in the United States. The script is written to explore Chicago, Washington and New York City. This is the second project in Programming with Python for Data Science Nanodegree program on Udacity. It takes in the users' raw input to compute statistics from the data.

### How to run the Script
This script is written in Python 3 so a Python version of 3 and above is needed to run the script. A Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder can be used as well. Anaconda navigator must be installed before the Spyder IDE can be used.

### Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. A link to download a copy of the datasets is https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/6094a7cc_all-project-files/all-project-files.zip. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.

The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration (in seconds)
Start Station
End Station
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

### Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
